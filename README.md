## What I'm good and "decent" at

###### btw `ass` is like ones i barely used (so basically tried) and either didnt use because it was ass or i js didnt like

###### `i guess` has stuff that i know and can do some basic stuff but not some actual production stuff, take python or bash, usually for ctfs or jetbrains ides, i can code in them (js like any other ide) but dont know its full capability so day to day life or js things i know for fun

###### `pretty good` are stuff that i can actively make something with or is confident with its abilities, idk take like nextjs or smth (my prim has fallen of from then tho) so things im pretty decent at or js things i with as a profession

##### really i can figure out mostly anything if given time. the only reason im not good in the `ass` section is because i dont like it and dont want to continue learning. like learning anything so far was js a matter of time
